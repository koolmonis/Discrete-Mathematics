1.The edge list contains multiple routes from big cites to small villages but every route is covered that is and was operative.

2.The edge list also has a start and an end point to it indicated departure start and stop timings.

3.This list is just a demonstration of how many vertices and edges will be present in the final project.

4.The Names of cities are vertices.

5.The Number of routes are the edges between big cities like karachi and lahore.

6.The Bonus Task contains all the remaining data and a unipart graph conversion which is already done since our data is representing a unipart graph with all updated edges and verticies and the data is 100% Genuine not taken from some other sources only from the Pakistan Railway's Official Site and this data can be used as a physical reference for a map for railway routes of pakistan which is the main goal for our project.

7.Do consider to read the discrete edgelist xlsx file its an excel file with all the route details and description for each up route and down route train along with their departure and arrival timings as well with the train names also included.

8.The data is 100% taken from the Pakistan railway's website so the credit for the data belongs to them.
